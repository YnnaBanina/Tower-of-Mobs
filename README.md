Unresolved Stretch Goals

- using an API for mob noises

**Major Wins** 
I was able to get my javascript to check whether the disk the player is trying to place is larger than the previous disk, therefore completeing the Tower of Hanoi game. Another win was my CSS, my CSS exceeded my expectaions for my remake of Tower of Hanoi.
